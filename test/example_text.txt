I put all my books in a box
to put them in a concrete cube and
underneath more boxes and hidden behind boxes
I’ll get in one too.

I just threw out another gift.
I know it had a bit of thought but
Mary we won’t talk soon,
I have no use for Crocs now
I have no use for gifts.

They’re gonna be piles.
I’m gonna be a pack rat.
That’s gonna shit.

It’s hard to empty out my drawers.
It’s hard to empty out my home. Now
I’m a vacant home for the last spark of a soul.
Gonna get drunk one last time.

It’s gonna get sadder,
it’s gonna get weirder
until I’m gone
until I’m gone.
It’s gonna get sadder.
It’s gonna get weirder
until I’m gone, now it’s kind of what I want
but regardless thanks a lot
for letting me stay on your futon.

It’s gonna get sadder,
it’s gonna get weirder
until I’m gone
until I’m gone.
It’s gonna get sadder.
It’s gonna get weirder
until I’m gone, I don’t know what I want
but regardless thanks a lot
for letting me stay on your futon.

I don’t know what I want, but regardless, thanks a lot.

I put all my books in a box
to put them in a concrete cube and
underneath more boxes and hidden behind boxes
I’ll get in one too.
